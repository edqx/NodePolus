# NodePolus

### ðŸŒŸ Please *Star* the project and join *[our Discord server][Discord]* for support! It really helps out! :)

NodePolus is a JavaScript library containing multiple implementations of the Among Us network protocol. Once finished, it will provide implementations for each of the following:

- A custom **region server** with **plugin support**
- A **programmable client** that can **play games**
- A **packet inspector** and proxy

Only the **region server** is in a usable state, with **plugin support** in its early stages of development. The **client** and **packet inspector** are currently non-functional. For questions and updates regarding the API, **client**, and **packet inspector**, join [our Discord server][Discord].
